# Movie-Seat-Booking

This is a simple movie seat booking webpage created using Vanilla Javascript. I have developed this project just for practicing. Suggestions are welcomed. Features of the webpage are as follows: 

1. Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript implementation.
2. Selecting movie and seats from UI.
3. Save data to local storage.
4. Populate UI with saved data.
